## Power Supply Options

There are four ways to power the emonTx3:

1. USB to UART cable - only recommended for short periods while programming, it is recommended to remove all other power sources
2. 5V DC Mini-USB cable - remove jumper JP2 when powering via DC if AC adapter is present
3. 3 x AA Batteries - remove jumper JP2 when powering via DC if AC adapter is present
4. 9V AC-AC power adapter - with jumper JP2 closed (If jumper 2 is left open then the AC-AC adapter will be used for power sampling but not to power the emonTx3 - see AC adapter voltage sensing and power supply below).

## AC adapter voltage sensing and power supply.

The emonTx3 is designed to use an AC-AC adapter to provide an AC voltage sample and also depending on the configuration power as well. If the emonTx3 detects the presence of an AC adapter at startup, it will automatically implement Real Power and Vrms measurements by sampling the AC voltage. Real Power is what you get billed for, and depending on the appliances connected to the circuit being monitored, can vary significantly from Apparent Power - see Learn for more info on AC power theory. **For best energy monitoring accuracy, we recommend powering the emonTx3 with an AC-AC adapter whenever possible**.

Using the AC-AC adapter also enables the emonTx to monitor the direction of current flow. This is important for solar PV monitoring. If you notice a negative reading when you were expecting a positive one, reverse the orientation of the CT on the conductor.

Powering via the AC adapter is only suitable for standard CT monitoring and up to 4x DS18B20 temperature sensors, transmitting data via RFM69 433Mhz radio. The power supply circuit is only able to deliver a limited amount of current without impacting the voltage sensor accuracy.

To avoid damage to the emonTx3 circuits, the current drawn from the AC circuit should never exceed 60mA. If more than 10 mA of current is required, it is recommended to remove jumper 2 (JP2) and power the emonTx via the 5V mini-USB connector. When JP2 is removed, the AC-AC adapter (if connected) will be used only to provide an AC voltage sample, i.e. it will not power the emonTx.

**If using the emonTx with an ESP8266 WiFi adapter a seperate 5V USB power supply is required.**
